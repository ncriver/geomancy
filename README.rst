Geomancy is a fortunetelling method that likely has an Islamic or Arabic origin. 
It was extremely popular during Renaissance Europe but went into a long slumber with coming of the scientific revolution.
One of the most common form of geomancy as it was practiced in Europe involves 
making sixteen rows of random dot markings on the ground, using four rows per figure to form four figures,
and deriving charts from the figures to divine answers to a question.

The 20th magic society Golden Dawn worked on geomancy's revival. Ecological writer and practicing druid magician John Michael Greer
worked on it further and authored a few books.

This module automates the process of forming the four figures and deriving charts from the four figures.

The structure of this module follows recommendations from http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/
