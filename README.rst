Geomancy is a fortunetelling method that likely has an Islamic or Arabic origin. 
It was extremely popular during Renaissance Europe but went into a long slumber with the coming of the scientific revolution.
In its basic form, the caster asks a question to the power, throws a two-faced die sixteen times, and writes down the results. Each set of four throws form a geomantic figure with a special meaning, resulting in four figures total. The caster derives a chart from the four
figures to divine answers to the question. One of the most common forms of geomancy as it was practiced in Europe involved 
making sixteen rows of random dot markings on the ground, counting the number of dots per row, and assigning the number 1 or 2 to each row based on whether the count is odd or even.

The 20th century magic society Golden Dawn worked on geomancy's revival. 
Ecological writer and practicing druid magician John Michael Greer worked on it further and authored a few books.

This module automates the process of forming the four figures and deriving charts from the four figures.
